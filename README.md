# Problem 1: Classification using ResNet18 Architecture

This project focuses on solving a classification problem using the ResNet18 architecture. The goal is to accurately classify input images into predefined categories using a deep neural network. The ResNet18 architecture, renowned for its effectiveness in image classification tasks, is employed for this purpose. The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing images belonging to various classes. The project involves preprocessing the data, training the ResNet18 model, and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics ROC and AUC score. 

# Problem 2: U-Net with Attention for Image Generation

This project tackles the task of image generation using the U-Net architecture with attention mechanisms. Specifically, the focus is on generating realistic images, particularly strong gravitational lensing images, utilizing the capabilities of the U-Net architecture. The U-Net architecture, coupled with attention mechanisms, facilitates the synthesis of high-fidelity images by effectively capturing and preserving spatial information. The model is trained on a dataset of gravitational lensing images, and the quality of generated images is evaluated using metrics like Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) score. The project involves designing and implementing the U-Net architecture with attention, training the model on the dataset, and assessing its performance in generating realistic images.
