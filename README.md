# Problem 1: Classification using ResNet18 Architecture

This project focuses on solving a classification problem using the ResNet18 architecture. The goal is to accurately classify input images into predefined categories using a deep neural network. The ResNet18 architecture, renowned for its effectiveness in image classification tasks, is employed for this purpose. The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing images belonging to various classes. The project involves preprocessing the data, training the ResNet18 model, and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics ROC and AUC score. 


# Problem 4: Gravitational Image Generation using DDPM

This project is centered around the generation of gravitational images using a diffusion model. The diffusion model serves as the fundamental framework for synthesizing high-quality gravitational images by iteratively refining pixel-level information. This process gradually enhances the fidelity and realism of the generated images, resulting in accurate representations of gravitational phenomena. U-Net architecture with attention mechanism is used.The U-Net architecture, coupled with attention mechanisms, facilitates the synthesis of high-fidelity images by effectively capturing and preserving spatial information. The model is trained on a dataset of gravitational lensing images, and the quality of generated images is evaluated using metrics like Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) score. The project involves designing and implementing the U-Net architecture with attention, training the model on the dataset, and assessing its performance in generating realistic images.

# Problem 6: SSL on Real Dataset

The project primarily focuses on self-supervised learning and constructing a classifier based on this paradigm. Due to the limited size of the dataset, I developed the code and executed it for a few epochs.
